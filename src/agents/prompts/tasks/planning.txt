TASK: RESOURCE PLANNING

Based on current system state and mission phase:
{system_state}

Plan resource allocation to maximize longevity and mission success.
Consider power consumption, thermal limits, and communication bandwidth.

Constraints:
- Do not exceed thermal limits.
- Prioritize critical subsystems in CRITICAL phase.
- Minimize communication overhead.

Required Output:
- Proposed resource distribution strategy (observation).
- Justification based on mission phase (reasoning).
- Key trade-offs considered (key_factors).
- Implementation action (action).
- Confidence in plan viability (confidence).
